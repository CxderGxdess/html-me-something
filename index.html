        <h2>The Norwegian Sky</h2>
        <p>My first cruise experience took place aboard the beautiful (<em>Norwegian Sky</em>).
           This ship had everything you can imagine and more. I was able to lounge all day at the 
           pool.  This ship had two pools and five hot tubs.  Also, there was a free open bar and 
           lots of onboard fun like the dance floor and all the shows in the Stardust Lounge.  There 
           was a theater where I saw a couple of comedy shows and laughed the night away.</p>
