        <p>My first cruise experience took place aboard the beautiful <em>Norwegian Sky</em>).
           This ship had everything you can imagine and more. I was able to lounge all day at the 
           pool.  This ship had two pools and five hot tubs.  Also, there was a free open bar and 
           lots of onboard fun like the dance floor and all the shows in the Stardust Lounge.  There 
           was a theater where I saw a couple of comedy shows and laughed the night away.

        <p>All resturaunts onboard were free. I ate a bit too much because of this.  My favorite 
           resturaunts on the ship were:
           <ul>
               <li>The crossing</li>
               <li>The Palace</li>
               <li>Garden Cafe</li>
               <li>Le Bistro</li>
           </ul>

           I was able to be seated with my favorite waiter Johnson.  He was awesome and so much fun. 
           There were counless food options for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I tried a little of everything.
           I think I miss the food the most :)

        <P>The first Island we visited was the Great Stirrup Cay.  I enjoyed this stop more than I anticipated.
           It was a nice private beach with beautiful clear blue water.  I relaxed on the beach all day and 
           drank margaritas form the unlimited open bar.  I was an amazing day that I will never forget.

         <h3>The Bahamas</h3>
         <img src="https://image.ibb.co/eNn4re/20180826_150605.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="20180826_150605" border="0" />
         <p>The Bahamas was absolutly amazing!  The beaches were beautiful, the food was great, and the natives
            were very friendly.  I made lots of new friends.  It was very overwhelming, there was so much to 
            see and do.  One day was not enough to take in this remarkable place.  I will definately visit again.
